This is Version 2.1 of my platformer/speedrun game S-Cargo. 

Currently, there are 6 playable characters implemented with 3 distinct levels. 
I intend to continue making levels for the game, and eventually publish it. 

In terms of where to take this game in the future, here's my wishlist: 
1. More levels:
    My ideal target would be 30 levels divided into three worlds: the Verdant Valley, the Misty Mines, and the Crystal Caverns.
2. Hubworld:
   To build upon the three worlds concept, I'd like a topdown hubworld to physically navigate through each world to each level,
    such that the player has a good idea of the world's layout by the end of the game.
3. Phone app build:
   I think this game could do well, perhaps even better, as a phone app. It's a small game, and I think that's expected more often from
   phone games. The control scheme would have to be done over, in addition to many other things, so this would be a big step. 
4. More consistent pixel art:
   I've gotten much better at pixel art since I first started this project in 2021, and the consistency in art style in this game
   bothers me. The pixel per unit is not even consistent.

I have more ideas and more things I'd like to add, but these 4 items are pretty significant as is, so I'll try to keep my scope 
more limited for now. I have other projects as well, so I know I'll be occupied elsewhere now and again.
