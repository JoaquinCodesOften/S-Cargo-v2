Welcome to S-Cargo! 

You are a Snail Mail Delivery Snail, but unfortunately, you've got butterfingers,
 and your mail has blown away! You must collect all of your lost mail and deliver 
 it to its recipients as fast as you can! 

 Use the arrow keys to control your snail's movement across all of the obstacles 
 and walls in your way. Press the down arrow while grounded, and you can begin to 
 roll, allowing you to traverse the level faster! Press X to jump over gaps and 
 small hazards. Press R to restart the level if you've messed up.
